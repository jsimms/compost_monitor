Compost Monitor
=====

### About
This sketch is for a device that measures temperature and humidity.

It uses the following products:

1. [Adafruit CC3000 Wifi Breakout & Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1469)
2. [sht10 Tempurature and Humidity Sensor](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1298)

It is one part of a larger [STEM lesson plan](https://github.com/jsimms/compost-instructions) around composting and computer science.

See also the companion web application called [weathervane](https://github.com/jsimms/weathervane) and and [5 minute composting lesson](https://medium.com/@jdsimms/quick-composting-lesson-5ebdf1ad31c5). 

### Thanks
Thanks to [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CC3000_Library) and [Jonathan Oxer](https://github.com/practicalarduino/SHT1x) for their libraries and examples, and [Open Home Automations](https://github.com/openhomeautomation/wifi-weather-station) for their wifi-weather example.

### Contributing
Please feel free to improve the Compost Monitor Sketch, or any other part of the lesson plan.

Here are a few things I'd like to eventually add to do to the device, not just the sketch.
* Use a power source that is not your computer
* Use a sensor the can be submerged longer than an hour
* Alternative ways besides Wifi network to send data  
* Design a case for the circuit
* Find and use cheaper materials
