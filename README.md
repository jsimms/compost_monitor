# Compost Monitor

This sketch is for a passive compost monitoring device that measures temperature and humidity.

It uses the following products:

1. [Adafruit CC3000 Wifi Breakout & Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1469)
2. [sht10 Tempurature and Humidity Sensor](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1298)

Thanks to [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CC3000_Library) and [Jonathan Oxer](https://github.com/practicalarduino/SHT1x) for their libraries and examples.

Also thanks to [Open Home Automations](https://github.com/openhomeautomation/wifi-weather-station) for their wifi-weather example


Remaining ToDos:
1. Troubleshoot why I can't connect to the complimentary heroku app and send the GET request
2. successfully read answer from server
3. Fix sht10 hardware (software is a-ok)
